# Twitter-sentiment-analysis

# Objective
 To Extract valuable info out of Twitter for marketing, finance, academic or professional research and much more.
 
 With sentiment analysis we can find out if the crowd has a rather positive or negative opinion towards a given search term. This search term can be a product but it can also be a person, region, company or basically anything as long as it is mentioned regularly on Twitter.
 
 We will be evaluating the two food delivery apps in India Zomato and Swiggy in three locations Mumbai, New Delhi and Bangalore
